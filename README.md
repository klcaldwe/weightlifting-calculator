# weightlifting-calculator
Problem statement: It is important for people starting a weightlifting program to know what they’re estimated maxes are for a given number of reps.  For this project, I will create an application that will calculate a user’s estimated max weight for repetitions of one through ten using five of the most well-known formulas.
Proposed solution: Create a Windows-forms application that will calculate perceived weightlifting maxes for repetitions of one through ten using five of the most well-known formulas based on the user’s input.
